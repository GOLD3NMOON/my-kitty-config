### My Kitty Terminal Configuration

This is my **personal** configuration for the Kitty Terminal, designed to integrate seamlessly with **GNOME**. I chose Kitty for its high customization capabilities and because I wasn't satisfied with the GNOME Terminal's direction. Also... *I am an anime boy :3* ðŸŽŒ  

My setup is inspired by the **Adwaita** and **GTK4** aesthetic, ensuring a clean integration with **GNOME Shell**. It has been tested on **Fedora** running **Wayland**, **GNOME 47**, and GTK4.

### Project Structure

After cloning the repository, you'll find the following structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ kitty.conf                # Main Kitty configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ assets                    # Optional, you can delete
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ kitty.png
â”œâ”€â”€ kitty.d                   # Additional configurations organized by theme
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ interface
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ fonts.conf        # Font settings
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ themes.conf       # Color palette and themes
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ window.conf       # Window and layout configurations
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # Project documentation
```

This modular organization makes it easy to customize specific aspects, such as fonts, colors, and layouts.

   Download directly from the [official Kitty website](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) or use your distribution's package manager. For example, on Fedora:  
   ```bash
